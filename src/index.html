  Usually you need to import quite a few things into the web page, like a CSS stylesheet to help
  make the page look good. The <head> section is where you declare most of these imports.

  Here, we're just saying "Go get the stylesheet that's called main.css and load it onto the page
-->
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">
</head>

<!--
  The <body> is where your actual content goes; the stuff that will actually show up on the page.
-->
<body>
  <!--
    You can think of a <div> as just like a "section" of the page.

    You can have as many <div>'s as you want, but here we just have one to be the main "section" for the whole app.

    We get it an id because that allows us to refer to it by name in our CSS and JavaScript.
  -->
  <div id="app">
    <!-- <h1>'s are just the big title text for the page -->
    <h1>Clicky Clicky Beep Boop</h1>
    <!-- This is obviousily a button, and we've also given it an id so we can refer to it later -->
    <button id="mine-bitcoin-button">Mine Bitcoin</button>
    <!-- <p>'s are just for normal text -->
    <p>Total bitcoins mined: 0</p>
  </div>

  <!--
    This is similar to the <link> in our <head> that is importing the CSS file, but instead
    we are importing our JavaScript file that's called main.js. It's normal to load this at the bottom of your HTML file.
  -->
  <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
